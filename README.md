# Osteoporosis Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on using deep learning techniques, specifically **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, to detect osteoporosis from medical imaging data. The system is designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy, providing a cost-effective and non-invasive method for early detection. It incorporates **transfer learning**, **attention mechanisms**, and **cross-validation** to ensure robust performance. A user-friendly interface is included for interactive analysis.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better model generalization.
- **CNN Architecture:** Custom and transfer learning-based models for feature extraction and classification.
- **Performance Metrics:** Comprehensive evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and sensitivity.
- **Visual Explanations:** Integrates attention mechanisms to provide interpretable results.
- **Interactive GUI:** Analyze and classify images with a Tkinter-based graphical interface.

## Dataset
```bash
./dataset/
    normal/
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
        ...
    osteoporosis/
        img1.jpg
        img2.jpg
        ...
```

Update the dataset path in the script to match your directory structure.

## Steps to Run the Code

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/osteoporosis-detection.git
cd osteoporosis-detection
```
### 2. Set Up the Virtual Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. If you are using venv, run the following commands:

```bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows use 'venv\Scripts\activate'
```
### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all necessary libraries by running the following command:

```bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Prepare the Dataset
Ensure your dataset is structured as follows:

```bash
Copy code
./dataset/
├── normal/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   ├── img2.jpg
│   └── ...
├── osteoporosis/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   ├── img2.jpg
│   └── ...
Update the dataset path in the script to match your directory structure.
```

### 5. Train the Model
Configure the dataset path and adjust any hyperparameters (like learning rate, batch size, and epochs) in the script. Then, run the training script:

```bash
Copy code
python cnn2d_training.py
You can monitor the training process through TensorBoard or by reviewing the logs.
```

### 6. Test the Model
Once the model is trained, you can evaluate its performance on the test dataset by running the evaluation script:

```bash
Copy code
python main_testing.py
```
### 7. Analyze the Results
After testing, review the results, including performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. You can also view class activation maps and accuracy/loss plots for further analysis.

### 8. Run the GUI (Optional)
To run the graphical user interface for interactive analysis, use the following command:

```bash
Copy code
python gui.py
```
This will open the Tkinter-based interface where you can upload and classify images.

### 9. Future Enhancements
Integrate the model with telemedicine platforms for real-world applications.
Extend the model for diagnosing other bone-related conditions.
Optimize the model further using advanced techniques.
