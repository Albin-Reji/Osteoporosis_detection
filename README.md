# Osteoporosis Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks

## Overview
This project focuses on using deep learning techniques, specifically **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, to detect osteoporosis from medical imaging data. The system is designed to enhance diagnostic accuracy, providing a cost-effective and non-invasive method for early detection. It incorporates **transfer learning**, **attention mechanisms**, and **cross-validation** to ensure robust performance. A user-friendly interface is included for interactive analysis.
